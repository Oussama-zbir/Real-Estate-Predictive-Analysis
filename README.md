# Real Estate Predictive Modeling & Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This data science project analyzes real estate data through two main approaches:
- Regression modeling to predict property sale prices
- Clustering analysis to segment properties for targeted marketing strategies

## Business Objectives
1. Develop an accurate predictive model for property valuations
2. Identify distinct property segments within the portfolio
3. Generate actionable insights for marketing and investment strategies

## Technical Highlights
- **Machine Learning Models**: RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Feature Engineering**: Selection, transformation, importance analysis
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for clustering analysis
- **Clustering Optimization**: Multiple evaluation metrics (Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin)
- **Code Structure**: Modular, function-based approach with clear documentation

## Key Results
- XGBoost model achieved best performance with RMSE of $22,420 and RÂ² of 0.90
- Identified optimal property clusters with distinctive characteristics
- Generated valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies
